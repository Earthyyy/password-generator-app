## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla JS
- ZXCVBN Library

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

- If a flex item dont grow, add flex:1 property to make it do so
- margin: auto can achieve sometimes the wanted layout faster than using flexbox or grid
- How to copy a text to clipboard using Javascript

```js
try {
    await navigator.clipboard.writeText(what.to.copy);
  } catch(err) {
    console.error('Failed to copy: ', err);
  }
}
```

- How to customize a range input
- How to customize a checkbox input

### Bugs

- When checked, If the user hovers over the checkbox , the cursor doesn't switch to pointer and the click doesn't uncheck the case


### Useful resources

- [Password generator algorithm](https://x-engineer.org/random-password-generator-algorithm/) - I used this algorithm to generate the wanted passwords
- [Slider styler](https://toughengineer.github.io/demo/slider-styler/slider-styler.html) - This helped to get the slider done in a short time without the need to care about the browsers issue
